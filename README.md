# MS-Graph-Webhook
Python files to create a serverless Microsoft Graph webhook for notification of new emails from an Outlook inbox. Then pull the email data and store it in a DynamoDB table.

The repository is explained in the Medium article [Microsoft Graph Python Webhook in Serverless AWS Pipeline](https://acmelton.medium.com/microsoft-graph-python-webhook-in-serverless-aws-pipeline-3d56c679b26d).

I highly suggest using the file "AWSRequiredData.txt" to keep track of information you will need to run the AWS CloudFormation script.
